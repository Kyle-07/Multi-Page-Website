    <!-- GPU Paragraph -->
    <h2>The Graphics Card</h2>
    <img width="500" src="img/gpus.JPG" alt="GPUs" />
    <p class="aboutP">
      The Graphics Card, also known as the Graphics Proccesing Unit, or GPU is a
      very important part of a computer. It handles the rendering of graphics.
      It is necessary in order for a compter to output an image, and for running
      graphically intensive games. It is also used for video editing, crypto
      mining, and 3d rendering and animation. Some GPUs are integrated into the
      CPU. These GPUs are called iGPUs, and they are common on lower end
      computers. iGPUs are generally not very powerful. GPUs are mainly
      manufactured by Nvidia and AMD, but Intel has began to develop its own
      discrete (not integrated into cpu) GPU

    <!-- CPU Paragraph -->
    <h2>The Processor</h2>
    <img width="500px" src="img/cpus.webp" alt="CPUs" />
    <p class="aboutP">
      The processor, also known as the Central Processing Unit is the brain of a
      computer. It is responsible for carrying out the majority of the
      calculations and instructions necessary for the system to function. The
      CPU retrieves data and instructions from the computer's memory and
      executes them to perform tasks such as running programs, managing input
      and output operations, and controlling the flow of information within the
      system. The CPU also contains a control unit that directs the operations
      of other components in the computer system, including input/output
      devices, memory, and the arithmetic and logic units. Modern desktop CPUs
      are usually from either Intel, known as Team Blue, or AMD (Advanced Micro
      Devices), known as Team Red

    <!-- CPU Cooler Paragraph -->
    <h2>The CPU cooler</h2>
    <img width="500px" src="img/cpucooler.jpg" alt="CPU Coolers" />
    <p class="aboutP">
      The function of a CPU cooler is to dissipate the heat generated by the CPU
      during operation. The CPU generates heat as it processes data and performs
      computations. If this heat is not dissipated properly, it can cause the
      CPU to overheat, which can lead to damage and potentially system failure.
      A CPU cooler works by transferring the heat from the CPU to a heatsink,
      which is a metal plate with fins that increase its surface area. The
      heatsink is then cooled by a fan, which blows air over the fins,
      dissipating the heat into the surrounding environment. There are several
      types of CPU coolers available, including air coolers and liquid coolers.
      Air coolers use fans to cool the heatsink, while liquid coolers use a
      liquid coolant to transfer the heat away from the CPU and dissipate it via
      a radiator. Pictured on the left is an AIO Liquid Cooler, and on the right
      is a single tower air cooler

    <!-- RAM Paragraph -->
    <h2>The Memory</h2>
    <img width="500px" src="img/ram.jpg" alt=" RAM" />
    <p class="aboutP">
      RAM (Random Access Memory) is a type of computer memory that is used to
      temporarily store data that the CPU needs to access quickly. The function
      of RAM is to provide fast, short-term storage space for data that is
      currently being used by the computer's operating system (OS),
      applications, and processes. When a computer is turned on, the OS and
      other software programs are loaded into the RAM from the computer's
      storage. The CPU then accesses data from RAM as needed, rather than from
      the slower storage drive. This allows the computer to operate much faster
      and more efficiently, as it can quickly retrieve and process data. The
      amount of RAM installed in a computer determines how much data can be
      stored in it at any given time. The more RAM a computer has, the more
      programs and data it can handle simultaneously without slowing down. This
      is important for video editing software or video games, which require a
      lot of memory to run smoothly.

    <!-- MOBO Paragraph -->
    <h2>The Motherboard</h2>
    <img width="500px" src="img/mobo.jpg" alt="MOBO" />
    <p class="aboutP">
      The motherboard is the main circuit board of a computer, and it serves as
      the central hub that connects and controls all of the computer's
      components. The function of a motherboard is to provide a platform for all
      of the computer's hardware components to communicate with each other and
      with the CPU . The motherboard contains a variety of essential components,
      such as the CPU socket, memory (RAM) slots, expansion slots (for GPUs,
      among other things), and connectors for peripheral devices such as
      storage, optical drives, and USB ports. These components are
      interconnected by a network of traces and circuits, which allow them to
      communicate with each other and with the CPU. The motherboard also
      contains a chipset, which acts as a bridge between the CPU and the other
      components on the motherboard. The chipset provides a set of instructions
      to the CPU that help it to communicate with the other hardware components
      on the motherboard. It is essentially the backbone of the computer,
      providing the necessary connections and controls to make everything work
      together as a cohesive system.

    <!-- PSU Paragraph -->
    <h2>The Power Supply</h2>
    <img width="500px" src="img/psu.webp" alt="PSU" />
    <p class="aboutP">
      The function of a power supply unit (PSU) is to convert AC (alternating
      current) power from the electrical outlet into DC (direct current) power
      that is used by the computer's components. The PSU provides a stable and
      reliable source of power to the various hardware components in the
      computer. The power supply is responsible for providing the correct
      voltage and current to each component, ensuring that they receive the
      power they need to operate properly. It also regulates the voltage to
      prevent any fluctuations that could damage the components. A high-quality
      psu is crucial for maintaining the stability and longevity of a
      computer.In addition, PSUs can be modular. Modular PSUs allow the user to
      only connect the cables that are needed for their specific system
      configuration, reducing cable clutter and improving airflow.

    <!-- Sorage Paragraph -->
    <h2>The Storage</h2>
    <img width="500px" src="img/storage.jpg" alt="Storage" />
    <p class="aboutP">
      There are several types of computer storage drives. One of them is the
      Hard Disk Drive (HDD). A hard disk drive is a magnetic storage device that
      uses spinning disks to store data. It is a common type of storage drive
      used in computers and offers large storage capacities at lowwer costs. It
      is able to do this as the speeds are slow.HDDs connect to the motherboard
      by SATA. A HDD is pictured on the right Another type is a Solid State
      Drive (SSD). A solid-state drive uses flash memory to store data, making
      it faster and more reliable than a HDD. They connect to the motherboard
      via a SATA cable. SSDs are increasingly popular due to their faster data
      transfer speeds, lower power consumption, and improved durability.
      However, they cost more. A SSD is shown in the middle. Additionally,
      another type is M.2 NVME. Technically, an NVME drive is a type of SSD, but
      they look quite different as you can see from the image. An NVME screws
      directly into the motheboard, rather than using a SATA cable like a HDD or
      SSD. They can reach faster speeds than a SSD because of this.

    <!-- Case Paragraph -->
    <h2>The Case</h2>
    <img width="500px" src="img/case.jpg" alt="Case" />
    <p class="aboutP">
      The function of a PC case (also known as a computer case or chassis) is to
      provide a protective enclosure for the internal components of a computer
      system, as well as to help manage the flow of air to keep the components
      cool. The case also provides a platform for the motherboard. A PC case
      typically includes a number of features to support the installation and
      management of the internal components, such as drive bays for hard drives
      and optical drives, expansion slots for additional cards, and cable
      management features to keep the cables organized and out of the way. In
      addition to providing physical protection and organization for the
      internal components, the PC case also helps to manage the flow of air to
      keep the components cool. A good PC case will have ventilation holes or
      fans to provide adequate airflow, and may also include filters to keep
      dust and debris from accumulating inside the case.

    <!-- Fan Paragraph -->
    <h2>The Fans</h2>
    <img width="500px" src="img/fans.jpg" alt="Fans" />
    <p class="aboutP">
      The function of PC fans is to help keep the internal components of a
      computer system cool by moving air through the case and over the
      components. Computer components generate a lot of heat, and if this heat
      is not dissipated effectively, it can cause the components to overheat,
      which can result in system instability, damage to the components, or even
      system failure. PC fans work by pulling cooler air into the case and
      pushing hot air out. This helps to maintain a consistent airflow over the
      components, preventing hot spots from developing and ensuring that heat is
      efficiently dissipated. Fans are typically located at the front and rear
      of the case, as well as on the CPU cooler and GPU.
